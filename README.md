.NET Core Docker Samples
========================

This repo contains samples (one so far) that demonstrate various .NET Core Docker configurations. It is the source for [microsoft/dotnet-samples](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-samples/) on Docker Hub.

A larger set of samples is available in the `master` branch of this repository. The `dockerhub` branch (this branch) was made solely to provide Docker Hub-friendly README.md files. You will thank us later, after you've looked at the [dotnet-samples](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-samples/) on Docker Hub
